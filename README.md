# CS-250-Final
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I always ask myself what I would expect if I was the user. I have high expectations so this helps me ensure that the users needs are met. I also go over everything that is asked of me and make sure that I meet those expecations when it comes to the actual programming. User Stories help with breaking things down and creating a better visualization.
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I try and work with a team when it comes to developing programs. Which is a key component of agile processes. Also making sure that I have good communication. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Always talking about any concerns and working well with each member of team. Picking up slack and never being afraid to ask something that you don't know.
